# Architecture of Infinity Loop
(That's how the project is structured)

## Overview


## Backend

-  src/main.rs - facilitates api for getting the frontend and corresponding data served to client
-  build.rs - compiles frontend in order to serve to a client

## Game


## Frontend

- dist/ - is automatically generated by the Yew framework upon build
- src/
    - components/ - contains actual ui in the form of components that define html and its functionality
        - board/ - contains components that enable showing a level
        - pages/ - contains the different pages that can be shown 
        - reducers/ - contains [reducers][reducer] that enable more complicated component state
        - utils/ - contains smaller components that can be reused by different pages
    - helper/ - contains useful helper functions and data structures
        - screen.rs - can be used to indicate which screen needs to be shown
        - local_storage.rs - helper functions and constants for saving and retrieving application state
        - level_randomizer.rs - can be used to randomize a generated level
    - main.rs - initiates the Yew single page application
